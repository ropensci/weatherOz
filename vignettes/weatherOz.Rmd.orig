## Introduction

{weatherOz} provides automated downloading, parsing, and formatting of weather data for Australia through API endpoints provided by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) of Western Australia, and by the Science and Technology Division of the Queensland Government's Department of Environment and Science (DES).
As well as Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology ('BOM') précis and coastal forecasts, and downloading and importing radar and satellite imagery files.

DPIRD weather data are accessed through public APIs provided by DPIRD, <https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/weather-api-20>, providing access to weather station data from DPIRD's own weather station network.
Detailed information on using {weatherOz} with DPIRD data is available in the [weatherOz for the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API](weatherOz_for_DPIRD.html) vignette.

Australia-wide weather data are based on data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data and accessed through SILO (Scientific Information for Land Owners) (Jeffery et al., 2001).
More details on using {weatherOz} with SILO data are available in the [weatherOz for the SILO API](weatherOz_for_SILO.html) vignette.

The BOM also serves several types of data data as XML, JSON and SHTML files. This package fetches these files, parses them and return a data frame.
Satellite and radar imagery files are also made available to the public via anonymous FTP.
{weatherOz} provides functionality to query, fetch and create `terra::SpatRaster()` or {stars} objects of GeoTIFF satellite imagery or a {magick} object of radar image.png files.
For detailed information on using {weatherOz} with BOM data, please see the [weatherOz for BOM Data Resources](weatherOz_for_BOM.html) vignette.

Following is a quick demonstration of some common tasks that you may wish to undertake while using {weatherOz}.

## A Note on API Keys

The examples in this README assume that you have stored your API key in your .Renviron file.
{weatherOz} will prompt you to set up your API keys automatically if you haven't.
For more information on the preferred method for setting up your API keys, see [Chapter 8](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron) in "What They Forgot to Teach You About R" by Bryan *et al.* for more on storing details in your .Renviron if you are unfamiliar.

To get a DPIRD API key, you can use `get_key()` and it will direct you to the form to request a key and provides instructions for using `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to add your key to your .Renviron so that {weatherOz} will automatically find it.
If you have already set up an API key, this will return that value for you.

```{r get-dpird-key, eval=FALSE}
get_key(source = "DPIRD")
```

You only need to provide an e-mail address for the SILO API.
Using `get_key()` will provide you with instructions on what format to use in your .Renviron so that {weatherOz} will auto-recognise it and if you have already set up an API key, this will return that value for you.


```{r get-silo-key, eval=FALSE}
get_key(source = "SILO")
```

Note that you do not need to do this separately, any function requiring an API key will prompt you if you don't have one set.

## Using {weatherOz} to Fetch Daily Summary DPIRD Data

Daily summary weather data is frequently used.
The following example will demonstrate how you can find and download weather station data for stations in or near Northam, WA for the year of 2022.
This example assumes that you have stored your DPIRD API key in your .Renviron file.

```{r nearby-northam}
library(weatherOz)

Northam <-
  find_nearby_stations(
    longitude = 116.6620,
    latitude = -31.6540,
    which_api = "dpird",
    distance_km = 20
  )

Northam
```

There are two stations within 20km of the coordinates for Northam, WA that we provided.
We'll choose the closest, Northam, station_code NO to fetch the daily weather data for all air temperature, rainfall and relative humidity values.

```{r get-dpird-summaries}
dpird_daily <- get_dpird_summaries(
  station_code = "NO",
  start_date = "2022-01-01",
  end_date = "2022-12-31",
  values = c("airTemperature", "rainfall", "relativeHumidity")
)

dpird_daily
```

## Using {weatherOz} to Fetch Patched Point SILO Data

Daily weather station observations with interpolated missing values are available from SILO.
The following example will demonstrate how you can find and download weather station data for stations in or near Toowoomba, Qld for the year of 2022.
This example assumes that you have stored your SILO API key (email address) in your .Renviron file.

```{r nearby-toowoomba}
library(weatherOz)

Tbar <-
  find_nearby_stations(
    longitude = 151.9507,
    latitude = -27.5598,
    which_api = "silo",
    distance_km = 20
  )

Tbar
```

There are 11 stations within 20km of the coordinates for Toowoomba, Qld that we provided in the SILO database.
We'll choose the closest, Toowoomba, station_code 041103 to fetch the daily weather data for all air temperature, rainfall and relative humidity values.

```{r get-patched-point}
ppd <- get_patched_point(
  station_code = "041103",
  start_date = "2022-01-01",
  end_date = "2022-12-31",
  values = c("max_temp", "min_temp", "rain", "rh_tmax", "rh_tmin")
)

ppd
```

{weatherOz} offers much more functionality that is detailed in other vignettes that document how to use it to get station metadata for any station in the DPIRD or SILO databases, get extreme weather events for the DPIRD station network, get minute data for DPIRD stations, get APSIM formatted data from SILO, get ag bulletins, précis forecasts and various imagery files from BOM in the respective vignettes for DPIRD, SILO and BOM data available through {weatherOz}.
