{weatherOz} aims to facilitate access and download weather and climate data for Australia from Australian data sources.
Data are sourced from from the Western Australian Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) and the Scientific Information for Land Owners (SILO) API endpoints and the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) FTP server.

The package queries the APIs or an FTP server and returns data as a data frame or radar and satellite imagery in your R session.
Observation data from DPIRD's weather station network are available via the [Weather 2.0](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/weather-api-20) Open API initiative.
SILO data is available from Queensland's Long Paddock initiative (Jeffery _et al._ 2001) and are spatially and temporally complete, covering all Australia and few nearby islands (112 to 154 degrees longitude, -10 to -44 degrees latitude), with resolution 0.05° longitude by 0.05° latitude (approximately 5&nbsp;km × 5&nbsp;km).
Visit the [SILO website](https://siloapi.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/) for more details about how the data is prepared and which climate data are available.
Agriculture bulletins, radar imagery, satellite imagery and seven-day forecasts are available from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) via an anonymous FTP server.

Access to DPIRD API requires an API key.
Apply for an API key by submitting the [DPIRD API registration form](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/form/dpird-api-registration).
Access to the SILO API is conditioned to supplying a valid email address with the user query.
Follow the API Terms and Conditions for the [DPIRD](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apis/api-terms-and-conditions) and [SILO](https://siloapi.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/about/access-data/) APIs.

Observation data from the DPIRD's weather station network is also available via a [web interface](https://weather.agric.wa.gov.au).
The data available is a mirror of the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API endpoints.
Rainfall estimates are also available at virtual stations (_i.e._, where no observational data is present) and is sourced from the Doppler radar service provided by the Bureau of Meteorology under license.

## Installation instructions

You can install the development version of {weatherOz} like so:

```r
install.packages("weatherOz", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```
## A Note on API Keys

The examples in this README assume that you have stored your API key in your .Renviron file.
See [Chapter 8](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron) in "What They Forgot to Teach You About R" by Bryan _et al._ for more on storing details in your .Renviron if you are unfamiliar.

## Example 1

Source wind and erosion conditions for daily time interval from the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API.

```{r summaries}
library(weatherOz)

wd <- get_dpird_summaries(
  station_code = "BI",
  start_date = "20220501",
  end_date = "20220502",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY"),
  interval = "daily",
  values = c(
    "wind",
    "erosionCondition",
    "erosionConditionMinutes",
    "erosionConditionStartTime"
  )
)

wd
```

## Example 2

Source data from latitude and longitude coordinates (gridded data - SILO API) Southwood, QLD for max and min temperature and rainfall.

```{r data_drill}
library(weatherOz)

wd <- get_data_drill(
  latitude = -27.85,
  longitude = 150.05,
  start_date = "20221001",
  end_date = "20221201",
  values = c(
    "max_temp",
    "min_temp",
    "rain"
  ),
  api_key = Sys.getenv("SILO_API_KEY")
)

head(wd)
```

## Notes on Data and API Endpoints

Note that most of the data are not static and may be replaced with improved data.
Also please note that SILO may be unavailable between 11am and 1pm (Brisbane time) each Wednesday and Thursday to allow for essential system maintenance.

Please also note that not all exposed endpoints of the DPIRD APIs have associated functions.
Development is ongoing.
While we are responsive to user requests, we don't make any commitments about speed of delivery.
